## **Why have this blog?**

> Because sharing is learning

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later. 

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work from the perspective of a Frontend Developer.

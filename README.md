> Sharing is learning!

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a software engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment on what I wrote.
